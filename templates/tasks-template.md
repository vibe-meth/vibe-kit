# Task Breakdown Template

Use this as a reference for task structure. Tasks are generated by `/vibekit.tasks`.

## Execution Overview

**Task count**: [Total number]
**Critical path**: [Longest dependency chain]
**Parallel opportunities**: [How many can run simultaneously?]
**Estimated duration**: [Rough timeline]

---

## Phase 1: [Phase Name]

### SETUP-1: [Title]

**Description**: [2-3 sentences on what we're doing]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome]

**Depends on**: None

**Estimate**: [XS / S / M / L]

**Unknowns**:
- [What might surprise us]

---

### SETUP-2: [Title]

**Description**: [Description]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion]

**Depends on**: SETUP-1

**Estimate**: [Estimate]

---

## Phase 2: [Phase Name]

### CORE-1: [Title]

**Description**: [Description]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Criterion]

**Depends on**: SETUP-1, SETUP-2

**Estimate**: [Estimate]

**Unknowns**:
- [Unknowns]

---

## Dependency Graph

```
SETUP-1 → SETUP-2
SETUP-1 → CORE-1
SETUP-2 → CORE-1
CORE-1 → CORE-2
```

---

## Execution Queue

```
1. SETUP-1 — Initialize
2. SETUP-2 [P] — Parallel with step 3
   CORE-1 [P] — Parallel with step 2
3. CORE-2 — Depends on both above
4. POLISH-1 — Testing & validation
```

[P] = Can run in parallel

---

**Status tracking during execution** (`/vibekit.execute`):
- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[→]` — In progress
- `[X]` — Complete
- `[!]` — Blocked

Example:
```
SETUP-1: [X] Complete, 9/10 confident
SETUP-2: [→] In progress, 7/10 confident, blocked on API key
CORE-1: [ ] Not started, depends on SETUP-2
```
